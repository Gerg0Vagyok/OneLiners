# Oneliners
(What do i say here? Oh yeah.)

# Must do before running!
run it in the directory where it will create a folder and put it there if its a .sh file!

# Requirements
every file is in a folder, it tells what it needs. for example: sh(file type)/installer(what it does)/node.js-and-npm(what is needed to run the oneliner)/example.sh(the file you need to run)
